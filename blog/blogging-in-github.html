                <p>
                     You might be thinking why ? Why would anybody wants to blog in github ? Exactly , Nobody wants to use github as blogging platform
                     since it is not designed for that. But I have been thinking lately, and wanted to implement this idea of mine to use github as a 
                     blogging platform.</p>

                     <img src="img/github-blog.jpg">

                     <p>The First Question i got is How ?? How am i supposed to implement this ? </p> 

                     <p>Github provide a file hosting services and github pages provide service to create simple page that render html/css files. 
                        Our challenge here is to create a blog without using a database. That mean i have to go to all the way back to early 2000s method of writing a post.<br> <i>Utill i figure out how to use html css and javascript/jquery to solve this challenge. </i></p>


                    <p> First I had to figure out , How not to repeat some html codes, like header and footer part, so i utilize javascript's <i>document.Write()</i> 
                    Method to create header.js and footer.js file and included in basic template page. </p>

                    <b>Sept 22 2018 </b>

                    <p>I see alot of disadvantags using github for blogging. I think should mentions few of them below: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since, No database is used, it is almost impossible to index the article based on dates or category. (unless i figure out something for this ?? i will check it out later.).  </li>

                        <li>New html files needs to be created for every new article. Since no automation is used, i have to do this manual in text editor. <i>(Solution to this problems could be a custom app that connect to this blog repo and that app contains a interface just like WYSWYG editor and when a article it published it automatically parse the article and based on the properties used (bold italic font-sizes etc ) it generates a html files and push to github repository ???  ) </i></li>

                        <li>Site states are invisible . <i>Although i think it is possible to Write a javaScript program that count for all the site hits.</i></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Let me mention few advantages as well : </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Only advantages of doing this is that it is <b>FREE</b></li>
                        <li>It is FAST.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        For now, I think i am going to create new html file for new post, since it will give me more control over article slug other properties. <br>
                        I am going to create the base template for article and use it to write new post. The Name of the html files will be a slug that can be used to navigate to article. 
                    </p>
