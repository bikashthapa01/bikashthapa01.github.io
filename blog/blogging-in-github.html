                     You might be thinking why ? Why would anybody wants to blog in github ? Exactly , Nobody wants to use github as blogging platform
                     since it is not designed for that. But I have been thinking lately, and wanted to implement this idea of mine to use github as a 
                     blogging platform.</p>

                     <img src="img/github-blog.jpg">

                     <p>The First Question i got is How ?? How am i supposed to implement this ? </p> 

                     <p>Github provide a file hosting services and github pages provide service to create simple page that render html/css files. 
                        Our challenge here is to create a blog without using a database. That mean i have to go to all the way back to early 2000s method of writing a post.<br> Utill i figure out i to use html css and javascript/jquery to soleve this challenge. </p>


                    <p> First I had to figure out , How not to repeat some html codes, like header and footer part, so i utilize javascript's <i>document.Write()</i> 
                    Method to create header.js and footer.js file and included in basic template page. </p>
